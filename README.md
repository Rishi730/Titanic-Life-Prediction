# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
To get my hands on Machine Learning in a Study Jam by GDSC, got to the Titanic Dataset for Life prediction in the disaster.
Got to know and implement various libraries like Numpy, Seaborn, Scikit Learn, etc.
Also implemented Logistic Regression model and Decision Tree Classifeir for predicting whether the person on the ship would be surviving or not.
